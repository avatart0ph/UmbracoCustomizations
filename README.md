# UmbracoCustomizations

## Roadmap:

  - DataType: Property picker 
  
	- just like how macro property picker work
  - Events Widget 
  
	- with downloadable .ics. this is based on http://www.vissit.com/projects/eventCalendar/
  - DataType: Notes 
  
	- like uComponent Notes (is it possible to not add it as a DB entry in umbraco? it takes up DB space for something not needed to be saved multiple times)
  - DataType: Autogenerate 
  
	- random guid, random number, incremental number (do we really need this?)
  - Place project as umbraco package. 
  
	- (Create actual data type entry in .cs so users dont have to create it.)
